# Intermodulation-Calculator
# Java Desktop App for calculating order intermodulation for two input frequenices 
# Intermodulation distortion is defined as the production of new output signals which are created from the nonlinear combination of two or more input signals. This intermodulation occurs because of the nonlinearity in the amplification process. The order of the intermodulation product depends on how many input signals are mixed and which harmonics of each of those input signals have mixed. Second-order and third-order intermodulation products
